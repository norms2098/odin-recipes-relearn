    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> This can be made with just water, sugar, and instant coffee. Your reward will be a nice tall glass of cold, creamy, perfectly sweetened coffee. If you don't have a hand mixer, no worries; all you need is a humble regular whisk, one strong arm, and a good dose of patience and endurance. Just be sure you're ready for the burn in your triceps and biceps. Dalgona fluff from this recipe makes enough for one or two servings, depending on how much of a caffeine rush you're after. It tastes great but is really strong, so use caution when drinking!</p>
