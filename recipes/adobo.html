    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> Everyone who tries it loves the traditional chicken adobo dish since it is so easy to prepare. It is wonderful when served over rice and is slightly saucier than regular adobo.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>    
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>â…” cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li> Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
