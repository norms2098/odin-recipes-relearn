    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> This chicken sandwich is not your typical one! The chicken breasts are cooked with onion, peppers, and cabbage before being stuffed onto hoagie rolls and topped with Swiss cheese. The chicken breasts are marinated in ponzu sauce, pineapple juice, garlic, ginger, and herbs.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup prepared ponzu sauce</li>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>

        </li>
        <li>Combine ponzu sauce, 1 cup cilantro, pineapple juice, mint leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, sesame oil, chili oil, and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat.</li>
